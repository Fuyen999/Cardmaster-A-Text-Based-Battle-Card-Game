the battle system I thought of implementing is from a mobile card game called card wars kingdom (referred to as cwk hereafter). I played this a long time ago, it isnt famous but it is really fun to play
the game is dead now lol cuz the developers decided not to update it and shut down its servers. You probably can't find it on play store or app store ady.
but the game is fun tho in my opinion. It requires a certain depth of strategy instead of just keep on pressing attack like a lot rpg's battles lol. But card wars isnt an rpg, i just wanna implement its battle system.

rules:
1. A player vs another player (can be human or AI)

2. Each player will have an avatar and a deck of creatures.

3. Deck of creatures:
	Getting Creatures:
	a. There are a lot of creatures available in game, you get the creatures by opening treasure chests.
	b. Creatures are categorised into different rarities (eg: common, rare, legendary etc.)
	c. Rarer creatures have better features
	d. In cwk, u earn money or gems every battle u win, then u use the money/gems to randomly pull chests off a treasure cave. There are some types of chests available. More expensive chests will have higher chance of getting a rarer creature.
	e. In our game tho, we can make this random chest pull thing or we can just randomly give out creatures on map or give a creature as reward of winning a battle
	
	What Are Creatures:
	a. The following is how cwk creatures are designed:
	b. Each creature will have six stats: hp (health), atk (attack damage), mgc (magic damage), crt (critical damage chance), elixir cost and level
	c. Hp is health, the creature dies in battle when health goes under 0. You will not lose the creature permanently after the creature died in battle.
	d. Other stats will be explained in the 'battle' section
	e. Besides the four basic stats, each creature comes with a set of 5 cards.
	f. Each card has different uses, and the set of 5 cards is fixed (cannot be removed, changed or swapped between creatures)
	g. Therefore if u are experienced enough in the game, when u see an opponent's creature on battlefield, u will know which card the opponent has
	h. The creatures are at level 1 when u obtain them in chests (Each chest contains only one creature, can change tho).
	g. U can level the creatures up by feeding them with cakes (obtained from battles) or feeding them with other useless creatures (feeding with creatures gives more xp than cakes)
	h. Levelling up increases their hp, atk, mgc. crt and the set of cards will not change.
	g. Max level 50
	
4. Battle:
	a. Before battle, the player will have to construct a deck of 5 creatures from all creatures owned by the player.
	b. How the player construct the deck depends on his strategy
	c. The deck can be constructed or changed anytime in menu page, but once you are in a battle you cannot change it (battle using the latest deck u changed to)
	
	d. Basic Rules:
		i. Every round an amount of elixir is given to the player. In round 1 the player will have one elixir, round 2 the player will have 2 and so on (max until 10 elixir, even if round > 10)
		ii. Elixir is used to perform actions in that round
		iii. A random coin toss (1/2 probability) decides who starts the round
		iv. At the start of the battle, five cards from the 25 cards (5 creatures) was randomly drawn to the player's hand. (not draw one card from one creature, draw from the pool of 25 cards, duplicated draw possible depending on card)
		v. At round 1, the battlefield is empty, the starting player will have to choose a creature from his deck and deploy on the field. Deploying a creature costs one elixir.
		vi. Since in round 1 the player will only have one elixir, after deploying he cant do anything else. To move to the next player's turn, the player should type 'next round'
		vii. Then its the next player's turn, rules are the same.
		viii. At round 2, the player can decide how he wishes to use the elixir he has (2 elixir), he can either deploy two more creatures onto the field or use a card with elixir cost <= 2 etc.
		ix. All rounds will have same set of rules
		x. A player loses when all of his creatures deployed on the field dies. (Even if he has undeployed creatures)
	
	e. In battle, the player can do three things:
		1. Attack: - by typing "<your_creature_name> attack <opponent_creature_name>"
			   - opponent's creature will be attacked and its hp will decrease by the atk damage of the attacking creature
			   - total elixir of current player decrease by the elixir cost of the attacking creature
			   - a card is drawn from the 5 cards of the attacking creature
			   - there is a chance of crt (one of the stats) % that the attack will be a critical attack. Critical attack = attack + 35%
		2. Deploy: - by typing "deploy <creature no.>"
			   - adding the creature on battlefield
			   - total elixir decrease by 1
		3. Use Card: - by typing "use card <number> on <own_or_opponent's_creature>"

Ya so this is basically how card wars kingdom works. It is really fun to play lol so i want to use this battle system in the project.
But will be very chur haha after writing this Im considering if we still want to do the walking on the map part cuz this part is so complicated liao.
I think this txt file will be quite messy cuz there are too many info to feed in haha for someone who have never seen this game before. So anything dun understand ask me.
Or if anywhere can simplify tell me also cuz i think if really wanna make it like this its a little too complicated.
